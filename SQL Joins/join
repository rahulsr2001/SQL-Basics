üåü Exploring Advanced SQL Joins: A Mobile Product and Specification Case Study! üåü

I recently worked on a comprehensive SQL project, showcasing how JOINS and UNION ALL queries can merge datasets to generate insightful results. Here‚Äôs what I did:

Database Structure:
product Table: Contains mobile product details such as ID, name, price, and brand.
spacifications Table: Stores the RAM and ROM configurations of the mobiles, linked by the product ID.
Key SQL Queries:
1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN:
Combines rows from both tables where there‚Äôs a match in product_id. This ensures we only get products with specifications.

SELECT product.product_id, product.product_name, spacifications.RAM, spacifications.ROM  
FROM product  
JOIN spacifications  
ON product.product_id = spacifications.ID;  

2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN:
Includes all products, even if they don‚Äôt have matching specifications, displaying unmatched rows with NULL.


SELECT product.product_id, product.product_name, spacifications.RAM, spacifications.ROM  
FROM product  
LEFT JOIN spacifications  
ON product.product_id = spacifications.ID;  

3Ô∏è‚É£ RIGHT JOIN:
Similar to LEFT JOIN, but prioritizes specifications, including unmatched rows from the spacifications table.


SELECT product.product_id, product.product_name, spacifications.RAM, spacifications.ROM  
FROM product  
RIGHT JOIN spacifications  
ON product.product_id = spacifications.ID;  

4Ô∏è‚É£ UNION ALL with LEFT and RIGHT JOINs:
Combines results from both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to ensure we capture all possible records from both tables.

SELECT product.product_id, product.product_name, spacifications.RAM, spacifications.ROM  
FROM product  
LEFT JOIN spacifications  
ON product.product_id = spacifications.ID  
UNION ALL  
SELECT product.product_id, product.product_name, spacifications.RAM, spacifications.ROM  
FROM product  
RIGHT JOIN spacifications  
ON product.product_id = spacifications.ID;  

This approach provides a robust understanding of how datasets can be linked and analyzed using SQL joins, offering flexibility for data integration and analysis.
